      Independent shops keep repair fair. The Right to Repair keeps independent shops open.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      When manufacturers don't make parts and tools available, they create repair monopolies and hurt small businesses. 
      <span class="highlight">96% of independent repair shops we surveyed</span> have to turn customers away because of repair restrictions. 
      If the Right to Repair is not protected in law, their businesses will suffer. Manufacturers at their own service centers can push you to buy new instead of repairing. 
      They can set prices wherever they like. And they can <span class="highlight">shred reusable devices</span> instead of recycling them. Having to compete with independent shops keeps manufacturers honest.

      <h2>Repair restrictions are everywhere.</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond restricting access to parts, companies block repair in all kinds of other sneaky ways. Sometimes they glue in batteries with industrial-strength adhesives. Sometimes they use proprietary screwheads. Sometimes they use software to pair parts to your device's serial number or motherboard, either throwing up errors for replacement parts or blocking new parts entirely.

      <h2>Without the Right to Repair, manufacturers will keep locking us out.</h2>
      <p>
        Nikon showed us what to expect from a world without a legally secured Right to Repair: They limited repair to their authorized shops, shut down those shops, and now only offer repair in two facilities. Repairs there are slow and expensive—but the only choice. Other manufacturers will keep copying this strategy.
