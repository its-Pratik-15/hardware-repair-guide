                <p>"The guide is comprehensive and well-structured, making it easy to understand even for someone who has never opened a computer before. I was able to fix my desktop’s power supply without any issues. The only downside was the lack of information on certain rare components, but overall, very useful."</p>

                <p>"The guide is helpful for basic repairs, but I ran into some problems with more advanced tasks like CPU upgrades. I wish the guide had more in-depth instructions for these kinds of procedures. Still, for simpler tasks like RAM upgrades, it’s fantastic!"</p>
